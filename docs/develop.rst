Want to contribute to the ``hips`` package?

Great! Talk to us by filing a Github issue any time
(it doesn't have to be a concrete feature request or bug report).

This package was created using the Astropy affiliated package template,
and everything works pretty much as in Astropy and most affiliated packages.

We didn't write any developer docs specifically for this package yet.
For now, check out the Astropy core package developer docs,
or just talk to us if you have any questions.
