To run tests accessing files from `hips-extra <https://github.com/hipspy/hips-extra>`_
repository, users must have it cloned on their system, otherwise some test cases
will be skipped. This contains tiles from different HiPS surveys which are used
by the drawing module. After this, the ``HIPS_EXTRA`` environment variable must
be set up on their system. On UNIX operating systems, this can be set using
``export HIPS_EXTRA=path/to/hips-extra``.

Want to contribute to the ``hips`` package?

Great! Talk to us by filing a Github issue any time
(it doesn't have to be a concrete feature request or bug report).

This package was created using the Astropy affiliated package template,
and everything works pretty much as in Astropy and most affiliated packages.

We didn't write any developer docs specifically for this package yet.
For now, check out the Astropy core package developer docs,
or just talk to us if you have any questions.
